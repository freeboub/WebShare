Web Share
======

Web Share is a simple android application which allows to share text contents.
This application allows to create dynamically share shortcuts in the system.
These shortcuts redirect to web link on browser.

Current Implementation allows:
 * Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
 * Web search (Lilo, Ecosia)
 * Marchand website (Amazon)
 * Copy text to clipboard
 * Open youtube download web site

Why?
---------

This app is a hack of share button on android.
I created this application because I don't want to install Facebook application on my phone (Intrusive, geolocalisation, battery and memory consumption, automatic video playback ...).
But I want to share content on facebook.

During development I just realize that the share button can also search on internet and I think this is a good hack.
So let's go!

And now
---------

Which social network or search engine do you use and do you need ?
Do you have other stuff to share directly with a web link ? 
Just let me know


How to add features
---------

FIXME ( open in android studio, read the code, it is very easy )
